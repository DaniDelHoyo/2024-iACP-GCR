## Motivation
The finding of promising anticancer compounds is vital in anticancer drug development. Recently, besides experimental
approaches, several computational advances have been developed to assist experimental scientists to identify potential
anticancer candidates. In this study, we proposed a computational framework called iGCR-ACP to predict anticancer
compounds. The iGCR-ACP was developed using the NCI-60 dataset, one of the most reliable and well-known sources of
chemical data characterized by screening results of hundreds of thousand compounds towards multiple cancer types. The
iGCR-ACP is a downstream application of AdaShare architecture, a recently developed architecture in computer vision
and TrimNet-derived molecular encoding scheme. This combination is novel and was first proposed in this study.

## Results
The
iGCR-ACP’s robustness and stability were confirmed. The comparative analysis between the iGCR-ACP and two state-of-theart methods also suggests that 
the architecture of iGCR-ACP is an effective architecture to deal with highly imbalanced datasets like the NCI-60. The results showed that the iGCR-ACP’s
performance was competitive and it can be further improved by combining other molecular encoding schemes with distinctly adjusted versions of AdaShare architecture. 
Our approach is the first combination between TrimNet-derived molecular encoding schemes and AdaShare-inspired architecture so that there is a large room for model improvement in not only this issue bualso diverse biological and pharmaceutical issues.
